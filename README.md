[Writing a Simple Operating System â€” From Scratch](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) (PDF) - A 2010 tutorial based on course material from a class on operating systems at the University of Birmingham, UK, written by Dr. Nicholas Blundell, the original course instructor. The tutorial was written as supplemental material for students to review before the course, and according Blundell, *"is not intended as a replacement but rather as a stepping stone to excellent work such as the Minix project"*.
